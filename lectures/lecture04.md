### Interactive data processing & visualization with D3 (Data-Driven Documents)

Once you have access to the to Scott Murray's D3 tutorial book, first of all, I want you to fork [the repo at this GitHub link] (https://github.com/alignedleft/d3-book). Now you are ready to skim the .pdf of the book--a link is provided in the syllabus on Coursewroks. If you do not have a GitHub account, you can simply download a .zip file containing all the sample code from the repository's pageÂ 

#### Intro to D3

D3 (a Java based script for creating Data Driven Documents) is a powerful tool for writing code to produce visualizations directly from data. It incorporates SVGs (Scalable Vector Graphics) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) in an .html context for conductign _transition_s (animations) and interactions on the web. The code is in Java Script, and there are plenty of excellent ready platforms you can use to start running your own D3 visualizations. 

For the start, download [_project-folder_](https://github.com/hassanpour/QMSS_G4063/tree/master/lectures/project-folder). It includes a version of D3, and index.html, which is the file we will run to see visualizatins. After skimming Chapter 3 from Sott Murray's _Interactive Data Visualization for the Web_, run a local server at "project folder", where you can load `index.html` (See Chapter 4 of SM book). 

```bash
cd ~/.../project-folder

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888 & # Python 2
python -m http.server 8888 & # Python 3
```

Now go to <http://localhost:8888/> to see the output from index.html. I recommend using Chrome. Once you open the page, go to View, Developer, JavaScript Console and you familiarize yourself with the environment. Chapters 3 and 5 in SM are going to be helpful. For editing your index.htm file you can use either [_Brackets_](http://brackets.io/) or [_Atom_](https://atom.io/). Both work fine. 

Writing a D3 visualization is bascially producing an .html file that runs a JS code in the body--it does not use any ready image files (such as .jpg etc) and communicates with data files such as JSON and CSV directly. We will use some JSON and CSV files later to see how it works. First, let's try and run a simple code:

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>D3 Page Template</title>
<script type="text/javascript" src="../d3/d3.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<script type="text/javascript">

// a short and expressive piece of text output here

d3.select("body").append("p").text("My First D3 Visualization!");

</script>
</body>
</html>
```

Note the easy (and customary) ways for reading CSV and JSON files into JS body of D3 code:

```javascript
d3.csv("My_CSV_File.csv", function(data) {
console.log(data); //Log output to console
});
```

Or the tweet JSON file we will use to visualize our tweets from the Primaries:

```javascript
d3.json("Primaries_Tweets.json", function(json) {
console.log(json); //Log output to console
});
```

Read more about simple data input in SM Chapter 4.

Now let's produce the first bar chart using D3. Files for SM tutorial book are available on the Book's GitHub. [At this link](https://github.com/hassanpour/d3-book/blob/master/chapter_06/05_power_of_data_more_points.html) you can find the sample files. See how the code starts with defining a CSS style at the header:

```css
<style type="text/css">
		
		div.bar {
			display: inline-block;
			width: 20px;
			height: 75px;	/* Gets overriden by D3-assigned height below */
			margin-right: 2px;
			background-color: teal;
			}
		
	</style>
```
and then moves on to use the style with the data fed to the D3 Java Script:

```javascript
d3.select("body").selectAll("div")
				.data(dataset)
				.enter()
				.append("div")
				.attr("class", "bar")
				.style("height", function(d) {
					var barHeight = d * 5;
					return barHeight + "px";
				});

```

For producing some colorful SVG circles--and to appreciate the distinct features of scalable graphics--you can [run the code at this link](https://github.com/hassanpour/d3-book/blob/master/chapter_06/11_drawing_svgs_color.html). All you have to do is to copy and paste the .html content in your index.html file, and refresh [your local host link](http://localhost:8888/).

#### Transitions and Interactivity in D3

One of the key components of D3 is the ability to make a _transition_ from one state of the JS output to the other. The outcome, as you have already guessed, is a kind of animation in .html format on the web. You can control the nature of that transition by a simple command ```.duration()```. Check and run the code for a [generic transiton](https://github.com/hassanpour/d3-book/blob/master/chapter_09/05_transition.html) and a [_slow_ transition](https://github.com/hassanpour/d3-book/blob/master/chapter_09/08_duration_slow_labels_fixed.html). The key to produce two datasets, with their own Styles and SVGs and transition between the two, just the way animation is made:

```javascript
 .transition()							
 .duration(5000)
 ```
 SM Chapter 9 is a good resource for becoming familar with the concept and implementation.
 
Finally, in [the example at this link](https://github.com/hassanpour/d3-book/blob/master/chapter_10/08_sort_hover.html), a combination of ```hover``` style-- and a conditional response on ```click``` produces a sorting response on the bar chart we made before. Note the following. 
 

```javascript
<style type="text/css">
			rect:hover {
				fill: orange;
			}
		</style>
```

and 

```javascrip
.on("click", function() {
			   sortBars();
			   });
```

SM Chapter 10 includes a number of good examples to start with. Check the chapter along [with the code](https://github.com/hassanpour/d3-book).

#### Examples

There is a wealth of great examples [on Michael Bostock's GitHub](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery), which you can embed in your visual analysis of the tweet dataset--perhaps even for your first assignment. Start working with these examples to familiarize yourself with data processing and visualization possibilities in D3. The index.html file in ```project-folder``` contains a number of those. 

We will discuss and execute some of sample visualizaitons using available data from the Primaries tweet dataset.
